66,Zombie Infection,"You do you get impersonation of Billy the Kid and blast away. You vaporize several of the infected, but you and your security officers are overwhelmed and you two are biten. You run and to get away, you get teleported back on to the ship. You try treating both of you in the sick bay, within 24 hours you turn into a flesh eating captain.

68,,"You think this was a way for the GAF headquarters to get you back in to answer other BS policy that you may have broken. Everyone knows that you are a bit of a loose cannon captain but one of the best GAF have seen a long time. This summons was probably a way for the GAF get you to check in and keep you on the straight narrow.  You have want nothing to do with their plans, a month later you were hailed again by GAF. This time the video they sent includes a female alien and a newborn. Oh crap, you remember her now!",,,1,-50,,
69,,"So you decide to go and entertain leaders of GAF. When you arrive you are greet to the site of female alien and her baby. She is happy to see you comes over and greets you, introduces you as the father of the baby. Oh back up the truck up.

71,,"The paternity test comes back positive and congratulations you are now a father. But when you looked over the results, you noticed something fishy. So instead of setting off any alarm bells, you ask the ships doctor to complete the test by collecting a blood sample from the baby. You matched it the GAF database, you noticed that it matches your DNA.  How can that be, you asked the doctor collect a blood sample from you and it doesn't match the one on the database. The database has been changed. Your real DNA is now show up under <admiral Plecashs>! This makes sense, since Plecash always had a hate on for you. You report this <fleet admiral jarvis>, your name is cleared and you send your congratulations to <admiral plecash>. ",,,1,10,,

72,,"You respond to a GAF ship distress call. When you arrive, everyone is shocked to see that the distress call is coming from a severly damaged USS Radford. The scanners are showing life on the ship.  Say yes to transport a boarding crew to the ship or no hail the ship ",74,73,,,,
73,,"You attempt to hail the ship but not response from anyone on board, it may be that the communications on board are damaged or this may be a trap. Say yes to transporting a boarding crew to check out the ship or say no and communicate with GAF for further instructions. ",74,75,,,,
o,,"You and the boarding crew transport directly to the bridge of the ship. It looks exactly the same the same as the USS Radford.

Say yes to opening the hibernation chamber or no to communicate with GAF on what you found. ",76,77,,,,
75,,"You contact GAF headquarters and they said that their intel tells them this a AVM trap. They give you the orders to fire and destroy the damaged USS Radford.  You fire at the ship <sound effect>, you blow the ship to pieces. Then something started happening, one by one, everyone on the ship started evaporating into dust! You send an SOS back to the GAF, you are the last to evaporate, you cannot figure out what just happen but you knew it was related to blowing up the ship that ship that looked like yours.

76,,"You open up the chamber and you are fast asleep, but you notice you a recording in your fast asleep self. Say yes to waking yourself up or playing the recording.",78,79,,,,
77,,GAF headquarter is very curious on what you found and they ask you not open the chambers. They give the instructions to not take  open any chambers and bring the ship back to the nearest space station. The GAF headquarters put the highest classification. Rumours later surface that the people in the hibernation chambers were the USS Radford crew from future time period. ,,,1,,,-20
78,,"You are about to find out if two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time. . You wake yourself up and he tells you he is from the future. Nothing happend. Your future self tells you that his DNA was altered when our ship when through through a tear in a space time continuum. The entire GAF was at war with Von Moniko's empire. They had completed their secret weapon and it was our last stance. You have to make your way to stop  <star system> to stop him and his empire. We will pull your, um out damage ship to the next space station. We will report to the headquarters and you will need to debrief the fleet admiral of your intel. You need to determine how we send you back to the time period you came from.",,,1,,,20
79,,"You play the recording and its you on the recording. If you are playing this recording , it means we have successfully made the time jump. GAF was making it last stance against Von Moniko empires, AVM's secret weapon is was completed. You have to make it <star system> to stop them before they complete the weapon. There is one thing you must not do, do not wake us, becasue we have been infected. The secret weapon was a biologicalwepon and turns everyone infected into zombies. We are in a hibernative state to put the infection to sleep, if we are awaken the diesel will spread across the galaxy. ",,,1,,,35

You have arrived at the planet and traced the signal to a specificaiton location. Say yes to sending a team to investigation the distress call or no for not risking anyone of the crew. ",82,81,,,,
81,,"That was probably a good call, since there is no way you could verify if the aliens on the distress call are still alived. If this is the same infection that has other planets, this would be a high risk search and rescue mission. You were not about to risk the crews lives. ",,,1,5,,
